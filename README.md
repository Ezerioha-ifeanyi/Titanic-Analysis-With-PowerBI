## Data Analysis With PowerBI

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
										

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
									 

It is true that this is a common data set in the data world that is used for data analysis as well as building ML Models.

This project seeks to understand the happenings during the Titanic Shipwreck.

Data Cleaning process was achieved using PowerQuery after which data visualization was done using PowerBI Desktop
